# Banco Wild West – Cloud-Native Lakehouse Data Platform

This project presents a strategic modernization initiative for Banco Wild West to transform its legacy N-tier banking infrastructure into a secure, scalable, and AI-ready cloud-native data platform.

## 🧠 Context

Banco Wild West, a regional bank with 1.4M+ customers and legacy middleware systems, faces high maintenance costs, data silos, compliance challenges, and poor real-time insight capabilities. To compete with digital-native fintechs, the bank must shift to a unified cloud platform.

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

- **Cloud Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Core Design:** Lakehouse with multi-zone S3 (Raw, Processed, Curated, Real-Time)
- **Key Tools:** Glue, Redshift, Kinesis, S3, SageMaker, Athena, QuickSight
- **Security:** IAM, KMS, CloudTrail, Config, Macie
- **Governance:** AWS Lake Formation for fine-grained access and auditing

## 📈 Business Impact

- ✅ 40% reduction in data silos
- ✅ 30% faster analytics pipelines
- ✅ 100% encryption and audit alignment (FFIEC, GDPR, IRS)
- ✅ AI/ML-readiness for fraud detection, churn, personalization

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1:**
- Migrate legacy systems via AWS DMS
- Set up S3 zones, Redshift, Glue ETL, IAM, KMS
- Pilot dashboards via QuickSight

**Phase 2:**
- Enable ML workflows using SageMaker & Redshift ML
- Stream ingestion via Kinesis, AppFlow
- Build real-time dashboards & alerts
- Deploy Macie & Lake Formation

## 🤖 AI/ML Use Cases

- Fraud Detection (SageMaker + Amazon Fraud Detector)
- Customer Segmentation (Amazon Personalize)
- Churn Prediction (Redshift ML)
- Operational Forecasting (Amazon Forecast, Q)
- Document Intelligence (Textract, Comprehend)
